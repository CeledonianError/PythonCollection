Although most " + words[0] + " are made from " + words[2] + ", they are categorized as " + words[1] + " instruments, because sound is produced by an " + words[2] + " reed rather than " + words[3] + " vibrating in a " + words[3] + "piece cup as with the " + words[2] + " instrument family. As with the other woodwind instruments, the " + words[4] + " of the note being played is controlled by covering holes in the body " + words[5] + " to control the resonant " + words[6] + " of the air column by changing the effective " + words[7] + " of the " + words[5] + ". The " + words[8] + " covers or uncovers the holes by " + words[9] + " keys.")
